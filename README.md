This is a new repo for a live training by O'Reilly.
This repo contains the following:

* [Colab Notebook explaining functions and statements](https://github.com/noahgift/python-functions-9-23/blob/main/statements.ipynb)

## Building Code

First create and source a virtualenv so libraries are easy to use
`virtualenv ~/.venv`
`source ~/.venv/bin/activate`

You can refer here for [ideas](https://github.com/noahgift/function-bike-rider)


## Building web based microservice

* Go to external IP address with :8080/docs
* Query the add API
* Note, you can also query via curl:

```
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://54.82.166.171:8080/add/20/20' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
  
```
